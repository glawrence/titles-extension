# Titles Extension

A browser extension to get web page URLs and their page titles and then format them for easy use on a website or content management system by generating the HTML. Whilst designed for my personal work with my Drupal site this should work in a variety of situations and therefore be of use to other people.

The best place to get Titles Extension from is [Titles Extension :: Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/titles-extension/) as this is where the official, signed release is, that you can easily install into your Firefox.

# Plans

Currently the Titles Extension has been developed as a classic Firefox Extension using XUL and JavaScript. The plan is to port this into a WebExtension and then easily support other browsers. In addition I need to prepare for [Electrolysis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox) and Mozilla's roadmap.

# To Do
* Convert build script to Python (to be cross platform)
* Make version 2 as a [WebExtension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions)
